Thicket is a python-based toolkit for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of
parallel performance data that enables performance optimization and
understanding of applications' performance on supercomputers. It bridges the
performance tool gap between being able to consider only a single instance of a
simulation run (e.g., single platform, single measurement tool, or single
scale) and finding actionable insights in multi-dimensional, multi-scale,
multi-architecture, and multi-tool performance datasets.

You can find detailed documentation, along with non-interactive tutorials from this repository of Thicket in the
[ReadtheDocs](https://thicket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This repository contains materials for Thicket's hands-on tutorial. You can do
all of the exercises on your own laptop using BinderHub.


### Running the notebooks online

We use [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org) to create a shareable and interactive
environment of the notebooks within a live JupyterHub instance.

You can access the interactive environment at this
[link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/llnl/thicket-tutorial/develop)
or by clicking the badge at the top of this file.
